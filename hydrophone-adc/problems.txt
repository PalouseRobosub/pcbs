Problems with Rev A of board:
----------------------------
- JX1 and JX2 are mirrored
- The USB and Ethernet ports are on the wrong side
- The vccio_enable pin only goes up to 1.8V but the 1.8V regulator enable needs 2.2V min
- The 5V regulator enable pin is only tolerant to 6V but is connected to Vdd
- The gain stage is causing some odd signal distortion with certain gain values - Maybe use nicer op amps?
- MISO and MOSI schematic labels are backwards on top-level schematic
- Pin 12 of JX1 needs to be removed from 5V as a result of the mirror
- The board has no mounting holes
- There aren't test points for differential signals or SPI
- Board edges are too long
- 1.8V LED resistor is too strong
